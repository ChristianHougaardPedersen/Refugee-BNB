# Semester Project - Third Semester - VIA University College
This is the Git repository containing our SEP3 project, Autumn 2022 consisting of the Refugee BNB system.

The purpose of the system, is to make it easier for refugees and hosts to connect and make agreements regarding accommodation.
The system is implemented with an N-tier structure, with the following implementation:
- The presentation tier is written in C# using the Blazor WASM framework.
- The logic tier is written in Java using Spring.io and communication with the presentation tier is done using a REST-API, while communication with the data-tier is done using gRPC.
- The data tier is implemented in java, using Spring.io and all data is persisted to a PostGreSQL database.
